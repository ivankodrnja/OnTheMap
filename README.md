## On the Map

On the Map is Project 3 towards iOS Developer Nanodegree from https://www.udacity.com/


## Overview

This is an iPhone app with a map that shows information posted by other students in the iOS Developer Nanodegree program. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.


## Why this project

This project gives students an opportunity to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework. It also allows students to authenticate a user.


## What have I learned
* Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
* Authenticating a user using over a network connection
* Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
* Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
